**Henry**: All right. This is Henry, and this is the Maintainers Anonymous podcast. I have with me, Maggie Appleton. I forgot how we met each other, but I know that you had a background in anthropology, and now you're pretty involved in JavaScript and the tech industry in general. So yeah, I thought it'd be cool talk about maybe how you perceived open source before and then being a part of it now.

**Maggie**: Yeah. So I think we met for the first time, at Joel's house. So I work for egghead, and it's run by Joel, and it was in Portland, Oregon. And then we hung out for a couple of days after that and got to chat quite a bit. And I remember just asking lots of questions cause I was fascinated by the open source community.

I vaguely knew about it, but not really in depth. This would've been back in the summer and between then and now I've ended up researching it quite a bit, very much as an outsider laymen. Sort of vaguely curious about this sort of odd world that if you're not in open source and you sort of learn the intricacies of it for the first time.. So I was an anthropologist for my undergraduate degree and sort of never let go of it, even though I work as an illustrator now, and it just, it's like the most wonderful culture to explore because it's so nichey and weird and subculture-ey, and has so many of its own rules and norms, and I think most normal people don't know about. So I've just sort of stumbled into it as an incredibly interesting research project for a couple months now.

**Henry**: Yeah, it is very niche, but then maybe it's also interesting, because it's so impactful, right? In the rest of the society. 

**Maggie**: Yeah. That's the ridiculous thing. If you ask normal people about it, they would assume it's small. And then when you realize about Linux, you realize about Babel even, right? Like running the whole of compiling all JavaScript that runs on the web, but it gets a bit mind blowing. It's so invisible in, in everything.

So yeah, mostly what I had stumbled across first, which I guess is like the obvious cultural angle that a lot of people take on open source, is to point out the fact that it, in certain ways, operates like a gift economy. Well, if we give a basic definition, this is one where people in open source, will have heard this a thousand times. In anthropology, gift economies a thing we love to talk about. It's like one of the favorite anthropological subjects that we bring out all the time.

**Henry**: Oh, I didn't know that.

**Maggie**: Yeah. It's one of those that gets taught in like Anthropology 101 very early on. And it's more as a way to discuss different economic structures?  When we say an economic structure, just the way that people exchange goods, services, anything of value.

There's multiple ways to do that and it's not one single system. So gifted economies is simply that the way one thing of value moves to another person is through a gift. And you know, we might traditionally contrast that with a market economy, which is when you exchange something of value for money or barter economy, right, thing of value for thing value.

And these sort of set up as the three basic ones. But really there's, you know, there's, there's myriad ways to intertwine those in different configurations in a sense. Like, it's not like we have only a gift economy or only a market economy. Um, so that's one thing I was, I was kind of curious whether open source people sort of thought that when they talk about gift economies, it's as if open source is all a gift economy.

Because the way I look at it, it's, it's very much, uh, a mix of both market. And. Gift in a way that's very, um, compatible and reciprocal with each other.

**Henry**: yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess I see what you mean, where it's like, it's not just those three archetypes, but like the combination of those and, and. Not to get too complicated, but I guess maybe individual projects could be different. Right. And different communities, like it's just like, almost like a hierarchy of these things are linked at different levels, like a programming language or a framework or a individual library.

Those all might have different like economies I suppose.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause cause. Gift gift economy systems. It's mostly about, um, the ideas, right? If I give you a gift, the point is not really the object moving from me to you. It's more that it establishes a social bond between us. And that's the important thing that we want to emphasize in the exchange.

Whereas in a market economy, we really are, you know, we're trying to make sure that we're paying the right amount of money in the past of selling it to trying to make sure they get the right amount of money. So the emphasis is on equal exchange value. And yeah, so gift economies, the emphasis is on establishing strong social bonds and also, um.

It works in a, in a way that's a bit of a positive debt. So if I give you something, I want to make sure I give you something of higher value than whatever you last gave me. And that sort of in debts you to me in a certain way, and it sounds a bit negative, but it's not meant to be. So now you next time would have to give something back to me that is more valuable than what I first gave to you and it, and what it does is it just means we all constantly in relationship with one another.

Um. Yeah. So, so I sort of read open source a bit in that way where, uh, not the people competing to contribute more than one another. Um, but you're doing it

**Henry**: That would be great.

**Maggie**: is that not how it works?

**Henry**: I don't know.

**Maggie**: Cause yeah. I don't know what's a. When you ask a normal pass note, Western and open source, you know, why do you think people contribute to projects or are the sort of like bog standard answers people rail off.

**Henry**: Oh. Um, I would say maybe one of them is, you know, people might realize. You know how much they have been given, I guess through open source, how much they're using and they want to give back so that that does sound like the what exactly what you're saying, right. They, but it's like kind of, maybe it took a lot of time to become aware of that thing.

It's going back to the fact that it's visible in some sense. You know, you're using it all the time. It becomes infrastructure and so you don't really think about it. And so that causes you to not really need to feel like you're getting back. And maybe. Maybe talking about the gift thing. You know, when I think of the gifts.

I think of like an angel, individual person giving to another person and usually in person, right? And so you kind of picture that person, you know them with open source, you might not even know who works on the projects that you use. And this is really true, like just personal experience of like you can give talks, like I've done that, and then people have no idea who I am, but they know babble.

Um, not that they need to, but it's just that. These two. I think this thinking that sort of like with, you know, online discourse, like everyone has a username. You don't really know them. It's just some black black box.

**Maggie**: Right, right. So then it is like, if the thing that makes gift exchange means something to us, if we lose that, um. Direct social relationship. That's what threatens it may be. That's what like makes the economy not quite function the way we wish it would.

**Henry**: If it feels that way. I don't know if that's always true, but, um, because, you know, people example I just thought of is like, you know, people look at stuff on social media all the time of people doing amazing things, you know, like, or just like the example of like, you know, you buy something online and then they put it on your porch, and then the, the, the.

Yeah, they, they put it so that no one will steal it cause they take it out of the view. And someone recorded that because they had, that was the camera, I forgot the name of that thing. Um, but you know, like, and they still tweet that to a bunch of people and then everyone sees that and they feel good about themselves.

They're like, Oh, I want to do that. I want to pay it forward. But so they can be good. But I don't know if that's just like, you just feel good about yourself or you're actually going to do something

**Maggie**: right, right, right. Cause, um, it ties into this concept. So part of, of gift economies is, is there's a principle called the, the no free gift principle, uh, that there's no 

such thing as you can never just give someone a gift and then it's like free and no one has any obligations torn one another. Right?

That negates the whole point of, of the gift, um, that, that if you've been given something, you feel that internal obligation to give back. Um. And there's lots of, you know, theories is that human nature is that, you know, who knows? It's just something we don't understand. Um,

**Henry**: are some uh, examples cause I can think of like, you know, when you, I guess families give other families gifts or when you visit someone's house, you give them a gift. Christmas, I guess. Yeah.

**Maggie**: Um, so for sure, uh, Christmas and birthday presents are always the classics that people refer to. Um, there's two good examples that are specifically British, but hopefully, I assume that might be American equivalents, but you can tell me one is, um, uh, rounds of beer at the pub. So when you go out with friends to the pub here, it's like, you will buy.

Everyone at your table or a beer, and then the next person does it and the next person does it. And, and it's, um, so there's three types of of gift giving. One's called generalized, which is parents to children where you don't keep track. It's all just sort of all comes out in the wash or a little bit fuzzy.

We all trust that. Like, you know, we, our parents, you know, fed and clothed us and we'll feed and clothe them when they're old. So that's generalized. And this balanced, which is, which is the pub drinking example, where you loosely keep track, no one's writing it down on paper. You're not that bothered, but you're sort of keeping tabs on whose turn it is to buy beer.

Um, and then there's, um, negative is the last one, which is where the, each party is trying to get more than the other person. So that examples would be gambling. Um, or like when companies give out free coupons, but they really hoping you'll just going to like. But you know, yeah, exactly. Two for one sort of deal.

Um, so that's where it's negative because it's as you're pretending to give a gift, but really you're trying to get one up on the other person.

Yeah. And so, yeah. So those are the sorts of the three main categories. But, um, when we talk about, uh, yeah, examples of gift giving, it certainly ones, like even just buying friends dinner, you tend to do it in one for one.

Like, you know. Your Nolan's keeping track, but you kind of know,

**Henry**: Right? Like when, um, when someone visits where you live, you'll like host them or you'll pay for them and then when you go to their place, they'll do the same thing for you. So it's kind of balanced.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah. Um, yes. There's all sorts of ways that that it's kind of funny. Like we always assume we live in a market economy, right? We speak that way. You know, economists always talk about the market and are obsessed about the market. We hold economists in rah, the higher God and in all culture. Um, but when you start to look around, you realize this, there's tiny gift economies operating all over the place.

Very intertwined with our market exchanges because I'm actually little like fun anthropology history story is. That we've always found in other cultures that have really strong gifted economies, they always have market economies that are symbiotic with them, that exist alongside them and help them. Um, so the sort of classic example it gets sort of rolled out in every anthropology undergraduate course is from the Trobriand islands.

Which of this set of islands that are, I think it's over a hundred net scattered. Um, and the people on the islands have a gift economy that doesn't operate just on a one to one level, but operates between villages and on each Island. So they have special like necklaces made of shells that travel to the right.

So they go. Um, like it's a clockwise direction around these islands. And so families will give necklaces to people who like live on the islands to their right. And then those, these shell bracelets that people so value that are given to families, to the left of them. And every single time they would travel to one of the other islands, they would have this big ritual ceremony of giving the gifts of either the necklaces or the bracelets.

And these objects had strong histories. You knew who had owned it, and you had this like story lineage. So certain ones were more valuable than others, and they would do the gift exchange, and then afterwards they would do the standard market fostering. So they would trade Woodford fish or this and that.

Um, but they, they sort of had a reciprocal. Um, gift economy going where it didn't matter. You weren't going to give directly back to the person that gave to you. You're giving in this really large circle and you just trusted that it was going to come back to you at some point by whoever was trading to your left or your right.

**Henry**: Mm. So that's like the whole pay it forward concept is then.

**Maggie**: yes. Yeah, but you, you do understand that it's in a closed system at least. So the people giving, they know it's not really a free gift. They know they're going to get something back from people who are coming around the other side of the circle. So as long as I think, I don't know if that, that really could relate to open source, that if you don't trust that the other end of the circle is coming back towards you, maybe an artist willing to give.

**Henry**: right. And maybe that's part of the issue where you need to talk about this closed system and like communities having boundaries. Um. You know, maybe part of the problem is that, you know, the scope is so high and everything's very vague that, yeah, you don't have an incentive to do that,

**Maggie**: Right. Cause if the, uh, if you imagine community is like every developer on the internet, that's a bit large,

um. I wonder if it does. I don't know if it works more if you're a small open source community. I'm thinking of something specific like view, right? That if they all really know each other and they're all building things, specific fee for people who they at least can recognize their username, they know them on Twitter, maybe there's more.

Or have you, have you actually seen like more active opensource communities when there's a smaller imagined group.

**Henry**: Yeah. I mean, you could bring it all the way down to like your, you know, the team, like the battle team or something. It's like, I. Um, you know, if you're on a team, you would want to trust everyone there. And so, you know, if I think about like governance, then I don't want to micromanage anyone, even if I'm like the lead for the project.

Um, because I trust that they know what's best for what they wanna do. As long as we have the same, I guess, guiding vision or that kind of broader scope thing. And I think that works really well where it's like, yeah, actually I was thinking about this recently where, um. With, with an open source project.

Sometimes you kind of, especially if you've worked already, you, you wonder, you know, should we have more meetings? You know, like stuff like that. It's like, yeah, every, most things are asynchronous and you, there's this feeling inside like, Oh, I need to like. You know, do meetings just cause that's what I'm used to.

And I think it's good to do the meetings because I would like to see people face to face. Um, you know, and I guess not in person unless we want to, um, I guess spend the money for that. But, you know, doing like a, uh, video chat, um, and just to, getting to know these people as people. Uh, but that doesn't mean we're doing like a meeting.

Right? So I think that's more of a, just what you're saying, like social bonds versus feeling like, Oh, with those company you have like the one on ones and like performance reviews and all this stuff. And I'm like, maybe, you know, open source should be different than maybe we shouldn't try to like copy all these things from the normal quote unquote company, just because we're used to.

**Maggie**: Yeah, I mean, it even ties in a bit to open source culture of, of the more I started reading about it, the more sort of impressed I was by the sincerity with which the community is, is really trying to like, invent new ways of doing economic model. Um, I mean, it is, it is quite impressive when, when you think about how.

The model of, of, you know, strict capitalist market culture. We all assume we live in it and that it's inevitable at this point. And it's just like very refreshing to watch people very sincerely, actively play out an alternative type of way of doing things. Um, it like speaks to a genuine kind of sort of optimism and imagination that like, we, we are not at the optimal system and we all recognize that.

And to actually try and move it forward in practice is like kind of a beautiful thing.

**Henry**: Yeah. And I think maybe that's what draws people to open source that you  

know, similar to like, if you think about like Wikipedia, like I tried to explain to some friends that are not in tech. I just say like, open source is sort of like Wikipedia for code.

**Maggie**: Right, right.

**Henry**: You know? It's glossing over a lot of things, but I think that's kind of the gist of it.

**Maggie**: Huh? Does that analogy resonate with people? Is that sort of the best touchstone for people who want in the community? Do they sort of go, Oh, okay. I think I understand.

**Henry**: I dunno. Like I think so because I think I need to explain something in like two, three words. Then, you know, Wikipedia is probably one of the most visited sites in the world, right? Top 10 I forgot what it was. And, and then people understand code because, you know, they're using apps and they think they know about programming.

So I think, and they also know that theoretically anyone could continue to Wikipedia. Um, maybe if they've actually tried it, they know that there's like admins and there's even bots and like, there's a process to it, but it's supposed to be, um, I guess ideally more democratic than just like the official one encyclopedia.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, it was a PD is, it is a good classic example for most people, but then I even think of, um, well, I mean, you would know, right? Like the open source way of doing things is so much more sophisticated and evolved in terms of how. I've, I've seen certain open source practices like I love, what's the plugin on get hub that shows the emoji for who did watch?

**Henry**: Oh, well now there is a a talking about the reactions or.

**Maggie**: I think so. It's like when people contribute to an open source project, it will like list, um, show like images of, of who did what and like, say they did copywriting, what they did code, they did marketing.

**Henry**: I think you're referring to, so Kent C Dodds, he made this thing like all contributors essentially, and you know, yeah. So before, or I guess now it's still get, have, doesn't have a good way of. Expressing like who's done what, other than through commits, because it's the easiest thing to measure.

And they focused a lot about the code. And so a lot of maintainers realize that open source is not about just code. Clearly there's a lot of other things, not just docs and tests, but you know, managing things. And so he was thinking, all right. We can't really, and a lot of these things aren't really measurable.

So he asks, essentially, it's like crowd sourcing this stuff where like, or you yourself can define like, Oh, I contributed art. So then I'm going to put like a piece of like a, the picture of, of art. And then now everyone can say that they did that.

**Maggie**: Oh, okay. Yeah. No, I really liked that. I didn't realize camp built it. That's great. Um, because just seeing that made me think that that is the, um, right. Like, if, if, if giving us so much about. You're just, you're just getting a social status, um, and power in a certain way. But, you know, again, it doesn't necessarily have to be in a negative way.

There's lots of ways you have social status, and it's not that you're an awful person. Um, yeah. It's just, it's just like a, a recognition that gives back in a way that I, I'd think like editing a Wikipedia article doesn't give you any sort of reflection back that you've contributed. Um, or is it, um. I don't know if you guys have done this, but Gatsby, I mean, they're like a definitely, uh, an open.

Um, and then also Mark commercialize blend of an opensource project, um, was sending out swagged people that contributed and obviously that's not sustainable for a true, um, community sourced, you know, community funded open source project. I though that was an interesting example of acknowledging contribution in some sense.

**Henry**: Yeah. Cause I guess with that it gets into just like how like logistics and like shipping things and all that. And I actually got a tee shirt for one of the first projects I contributed to was just angular one. I did a bunch of, um, essentially just linting fixes, like spaces and stuff. And. And I got an email from one of the maintainers, like, Hey, thanks for your work, here's a tee shirt.

And I was like, Whoa. And that like, super, it really dated, encouraged me. So I, that definitely doesn't work.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Henry**: I ha we haven't done that ourselves. So,

**Maggie**: And it was probably less about the tee shirt, right. Then this thing of the idea that you now belong to a certain community, um,

**Henry**: Yeah, it, it does. I mean, the small version of that is like stickers and you know, you know, companies can print out thousands of stickers and they kind of leave them on the table, um, which is fine for them. But like for me, it's like, no, I, it costs money. So I'm like, and I also feel weird wearing, it's like.

If I just leave it out there like they don't even know me, or if they get to like talk with me or something, I'd rather like get to know someone and talk to them and then like at the end like, Hey, if you want a sticker, I'll give it to you kind of thing.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah,

**Henry**: kind of just like.

**Maggie**: because that's an actual rate, like, uh, socially meaningful gift as opposed to actually the, the free sticker on the table is the exact, like. Idea of the free gift that then becomes isn't valuable to us because there's no human attached to it.

**Henry**: Yeah. I guess that does remind me of what you're saying about gifts where it's like, it's not really about the sticker t-shirt, it's about, it's almost like a reminder that we 

had that interaction or something. Right. Versus the thing itself, it doesn't really matter what that was. Hey, meeting someone, having career conversations.

It's like the takeaway,

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I just, I was just curious whether OSS projects had, had thought, a, whether it's a discussion in the community about creating ritual around, uh, contributors and acknowledging contributors.

**Henry**: Yeah, I think that would be, that's something that we should be thinking about. Um, I mean, this ties into like my experiences in, in the religious setting where it's like everything is about ritual. Um, and, and I think. Yeah, they got me thinking. I actually did like a discussion at the maintainers conference in DC a few months ago, and I called about like open source as liturgy and liturgy is just another word for ritual in a way with other people, and it's kind of.

Well, yeah. What are the rituals that we participate in? Um, and it is kind of hard to think about what those are if you never thought of it that way. But some of the ones I thought of are like, we do have like more, like there are ratios of all different sizes, right? So one would be like a yearly thing that would be like heck Tobar Fest every year get, have general ocean.

They do that thing where they try to get new people to get involved and there's like a, that day. Um, which is good and bad because from the maintainer point of view, that's the day where you're going to get like a hundred PRS that you have to review, which is not necessarily something that you want.

so it kind of reminds me of this thing of like, I would like.

You know, an opportunity for people that use open source to thank the people that do have maintainers, the, uh, so like, you know, why is, you know, why are they calling get hub issues? It almost has a negative connotation already. And so some people suggested maybe we should have like a thanks tab. Um, but if we had a day where we just thank people with the maintainers, feel overwhelmed by the thanks, anything like that.

It's kind of funny to think that, um, or that. You know, when it's all coordinated that way, it doesn't feel as like, you know, genuine, I suppose, even though it is. So, it's kind of funny how it kind of, um, it's a lot more nuance. You can't just like create this sense of, you know, uh, people actually being thankful.

But when you get that random email from someone, you're like, wow, I really feel it. You know?

**Maggie**: Right. Right. Yeah. Cause that is with, especially with ritual, um. It is. Okay. You need to open up the space for someone to have the option to see thanks, but not in some sort of like, here's a meeting time and you're going to get on and say thanks. Right. Cause that's when it feels manufactured to us. But, but yeah, you, you would know through, through lived experience more as well, like actually participating in rituals where there's, there's like open space for what you can and can't do.

And there's not strict rules, but they're sort of, you sort of. No, you know, gives you an opportunity to explore giving thanks or, or acknowledging certain things, uh, in a way that's like a balance of like agency and, and social control.

**Henry**: Yeah. And actually now I think about it. You know, with church or this kind of thing, a lot of rituals are fixed in a way. So like, you know, we go to worship on Sunday or something, or you have your small group every week and you know, I'm just talking from my own experience. Um, we have a prayer meeting on Wednesday.

These are all like very fixed things. And you would think that would be my bad thing. But it's like, actually sometimes. We need the rituals because we're not in, we're not in the mood

to feel a certain way. And one of the most important things I'm trying to learn is kind of this thing of like, um, like changing our behavior through these rituals and actions rather than just thinking our way.

To changing ourselves.

**Maggie**: right,

**Henry**: The act of doing, going through these motions essentially, um, can lead you to believe, um, even you don't want to stay there. Cause like, obviously going through the motions is not the most, it's a negative thing, but I think we should acknowledge that the emotions help us to feel a certain way when we're not feeling well.

**Maggie**: Right, right. Cause yeah, it is. It's just the ritual sets at  a loose structure where like if you, you know, going to church every Sunday, it's it, you don't have a set, you don't, not every Sunday is exactly the same. And you have certain instructors that will always happen, but then there's still sort of a, your own agency to play within those.

**Henry**: Yeah. And I think for me it kind of reminds me of this idea of, and maybe this is related to gift-giving, to a surrender. So that is, uh, something, you know, none of us really want to do cause we want to feel in control. And part of that is, you know, doing something over and over is kind of. Not, you're not in control in that moment, right?

You have to kind of surrender to whatever this thing is. And that for me is actually a source of freedom. And I think that's difficult to realize because we tend to think of freedom in terms of, uh, you know, I'm, you're gonna use the term like negative freedom versus positive freedom, negative freedom, meaning no one's forcing me to do stuff, and I want to be able to have the agency to choose, uh, versus freedom where it's like within this.

You know, boundary lists limitation. I am free to, you know what you said, explore that space, 

**Maggie**: Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's similar to even pull it to like creativity, but like, especially with design, you always say the best design happens within confined boundaries. You know, you set yourself off the grid and then you work within it. Um, but a completely blank page is, is, is the worst. You know, it's unhelpful and you're never going to 

get anything good out of it.

**Henry**: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah,

**Maggie**: Um, yeah. So thinking of, um. Other things related to to this, I suppose gets more into like the broader economics of open source and not necessar solely. There's like the gift economy aspect, right? Which like, you know, you kind of get, it fits, it works. Um, is there, is there still, uh, an opinion in the industry of, um, not bafflement but confusion about why it exists?

Is that still a thing? Because in researching I stumbled across. Research papers by probably more accurate, you know, economists or, or political scientists who had very sincerely write academic papers going, you know, open source is such a confusing, contradictory thing. Why would people give away their free labor?

This makes no sense. Um, and treating it as if it's some sort of mystery which reading those I, you know, I sort of snarkily read them in like that anthropological way of being like, it's obvious why they do it. Like social meaning means more to us, the money, everything we do proves that all the time. Um, I was curious whether within, within the industry, um, it did, would they read those papers and think they would daft or sort of, is everyone a bit confused as to why it works.

**Henry**: Huh? I mean, I guess I can't speak for everyone, even though I guess I'm in a lot more involved than most people. I'm not, I don't know. I could say it's both in a way where.

Um, maybe firstly I want to say that there's a difference between what people say they believe and what they actually believe. So maybe all of us are like, Oh yeah, I think open source is a thing, but the way we act, we don't actually maybe appreciate or, um.

I guess, I don't know the right word, but it's like, I think it's kind of like everyone has an awareness of opensource because, you know, at this point, literally 99% of all software is going to use open source, but that doesn't mean that their behavior is different because they know that facts are of that belief.

Um, they just, like I was saying before, it was just, it's just there. And so it's kind of a knowledgement of like, if this is. A thing that opens doors is by volunteers and all that stuff. Yeah. Maybe we should do something about it. Um,

**Maggie**: It might just it. So you have the idea that maybe it's like this is not the right tools. That sounds a bit, you know, um, but like pantry on, right is like one of the only platforms that have that kind. And what does the open source collective is the other one. Oh,  

what's good hubs version?

**Henry**: okay. How the sponsors.

**Maggie**: Get a phones that just came out like last year though, right?

**Henry**: This year actually. Oh, yeah, you're right. Like, sorry. Yeah. I guess last year is

**Maggie**: still 2019, technically in my head. Um, yeah, that is also so incredibly new. Like it's sort of all the structures for it just being invented off the cuff that, um, maybe it is, it was in that awkward transition phase.

**Henry**: Well, I guess like, like what you said, I think a lot of this stuff isn't necessarily new if we think about the gift economy thing, but you know, actually I remember, um, I saw a tweet from somebody that was talking about how like. The, I mean, you know, the idea of patriarchy comes from patron. And so there are people that they wrote like books or were able to create music or art because people sponsored them.

So, you know, that idea is definitely there. But the difference, I think with patron and these things is that it's online. So, you know, with them it's probably, they know all those people, right, that are sponsoring them. But with this, it's like, it's kind of almost one way where like, you don't know these people, but they know you.

And that is very different, I think, and obviously global, where it's like in the world and they can stop at any point as well every month, which could be kind of part of the problem where you kind of feel like people are always asking me, aren't you scared that like, you know, any moment, all the money could be going away because of the economy or whatever is something that happened in their lives.

Um, there's definitely a psychology of. Patriot age, if you want to call it that, that I have thought about a lot as well. Um,

**Maggie**: But now it does seem the pantry on model. It is. I mean, I always, I always like sort of a little bit talk about, right, like internet culture as it's also so brand new. Like it's like the internet is still a complete baby and we have yet to figure it out. Obviously like given like the sort of all the awful things that sometimes play out on the internet.

And pantry on also seems like it's very much part of that. Like it's, it's very much like we realize this isn't really lacking, right? Because you know, someone who subscribes to your pantry on doesn't really get like a meaningful social interaction with you, which is probably what they want in some consents by through their monthly payment and like.

You don't know who these people are in any meaningful human sense of like having a social interaction with them in a bond. So like on a fundamental level at this whole, this whole system is like, not, not doing what we need it to. Um, yeah.

**Henry**: have like I have a lot of thoughts with that. Cause like even patron, I think they try to, you know, it used to be like there was Kickstarter, right? And that was a big thing.  

And you go to all these different things. Um, even go fund me. And so with , they essentially were going to call themselves a crowd funding platform too.

It just happened to be monthly, right. Instead of one time. That's a big difference. But I think they've changed their, like motto to be more of like a membership platform, which is kind of speaking to what you were trying to say with a, like, it's not really about funding, but about like creating a community or a group of people.

Um, that kind of. Align on the same thing, but at the same time it is kind of interesting how. Yeah. You could say in a way the market will affect the product. And so, um, most of these platforms are all focused on, I mean, I guess maybe you could say rightly or wrongly on my money. Right. And so the UI is focused on that.

And so it's not really about making relationship, it's about extracting money from people. It feels like, Hey, you can say the same with GitHub. I, I feel like it hub is also, even though it's about open source, a lot of times it feels. It's transactional in a way as well. It's like efficiency of code and project management versus like dealing with, you know, burnout or, um, uh, mentorship or onboarding or off-boarding, even like all these different concepts that are not in the product because you have to do all these things outside.

So you kind of have to work around the system. Um, example in Patrion, uh. And, and now I'll get help sponsors. For me, what I did was, you know, they had this idea of tears, and that is just, I guess, total totally from Kickstarter, right? You know, if you give this much, you get this thing back. I mean, you could say that is like a gift economy kind of thing, but.

Um, I think in practice it leads to its own form of entitlement, possibly. Right? Because before it was free, people are already very entitled. They're like, you know, fix my bug, that

**Maggie**: Right. Right.

**Henry**: And then now it's like, Oh, I gave you a dollar, so now you should talk to me for an hour, or something like that.

And so like the value of who you are, because like nothing, and this is why it kind of reminds me of like the busking thing, where it's like. Are you actually worth that much? And, um, so I tried to purposely change my tears so that, you know, there's not a easy way to monetize or put a value to the thing that you're essentially paying for it on the tiers.

So I thought of things are very personal and. I, yeah, I tried to make the whole thing more personal. So you know, like for me, I like board games and video games. So I thought of a number that was tied to that. So like Southern wanders is a board game, so I said $7 I'll play board games with you. And it's not like a, it doesn't mean like playing board games with me is equal to that, but it's just kind of arbitrary thing.

I thought it would be funny. And then you have to like be in the same place as me, right? Yeah. I have to, I think go to your city or you come to me. It's kind of like a special park that I would do it for free. I don't need that to, you know, play games with you

**Maggie**: Right.

**Henry**: but I think that it's a good way to kind of get people to think a little bit differently about supporting what I'm doing.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Your your pantry on rewards with some of my favorites of all the ones I've seen, like isn't one of them. Like I'll play ping pong with you. Yeah,

**Henry**: yup.

**Maggie**: I mean it is, it is. Cause now, you know, you're making me think of it like that pantry on in a way is running under the guise of being a gift economy. Right?

All their marketing language in the way they pitch themselves is very much that we all supporting the new internet gift economy, but on the actual functional level, they are pure. The way their tools are designed and built. Is is for a market economy, right? They're like $5 and the everyone else is like tee shirts and posters and they'll do this and that for that amount of money.

And so it's sort of like just using the gift economy staff to like sell the thing and then definitely not following through on it and the way it works. Um,

**Henry**: I think it's because, I mean, this is probably similar. I think it's the same as like designing and like everything else. It's like. We don't know how to not think in the market economy, I think.

**Maggie**: yeah,

**Henry**: And so like when we make a website, it's, you know, that does that joke about how there's only two layouts.

**Maggie**: yes.

**Henry**: Um, and so I think it's similar. It's like when we make the say, Oh, of course we need tears, of course we need this. It's, it's, it's just a fundamentally different way of seeing the world. And in some way, maybe, maybe, I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's like, it's just, I don't know. We don't know how to even.

Start thinking about how that works because it does slowly turn into this, you know, consumerism sort of thing, right? You become a brand, a brand, and you're selling t-shirts and stickers and it's just like, I don't want to be like a corporate whatever, right?

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it is a little bit inevitable of simply that like we are now in this like historical moment of born into a period where like capitalism is sort of the overarching. Well view, but you know, anyone who's done the slightest bit of reading about history, you know, you know, there's been all sorts of different ways of organizing society over time and organizing economies and markets and that, uh, it's certainly not like the end all be all like thing that will always be.

So I like, I like to have like the optimistic hope that we're just sort of muddling through it and that in that things like pantry on our, like a sort of. Good signal that we, we like the ideals of the gift economy. We're not playing them out yet, but it's sort of like we've, we've said we want to go running every morning, whether we will or not is still like we, you know, to be determined.

Um, sort of putting it, putting it like as a, as a goal, but very much not doing it yet. Um, so I'm, I don't know, I'm really hopeful that like in the next, you know, decade or whatever of the internet that we would find more ways to . Preference that that actual social interaction element over like $5 for a tee shirt sort of functionality.

**Henry**: How do you, how do you think we'll get there?

**Maggie**: Well, a lot of this is, is related to develop as an open source, really, right? When you think about the power that program has have in the wild and their ability to like define the way that the internet works and what tools do and don't get built, um, I think this is what fascinates me mostly about looking at programming from an anthropological point of view is that the.

The cultural power that program is have is enormous. And yet that's never spoken about in the community, right? Like if you think of everyone who's, who's building apps all the time or building tools, um, and they of course build tools that you know, will be useful to them and they think will be valuable to society.

So then it makes you think, well, what they think is valuable to society is like the core. Belief that sort of becomes the engine for what gets built. Um, and so you see a lot of, you know, um, sort of maybe very quantitative numerical self-improvement tools go around a lot, which tells you that that's something that program is, think is a good valuable thing.

And not that it's not, but that's a very, uh, uh, overly represented app group.

**Henry**: Right. Like the idea that like we are going to solve all our problems from some app or something.

**Maggie**: do list app specifically. Um, preferably one with charts and graphs and that has an API to everything else.

**Henry**: Yeah, I guess I absolutely, I struggle with that. It's like I have this engineering background, but then I had this faith background and I feel like they're not, it's not that it's in conflict. It's more of like, I don't want to measure everything. And I don't think it's maybe even a good idea to measure some things.

You know, if you think about something like a prayer or something, or like, I don't know, it's like, is that something that you want to really like make efficient? It doesn't, it doesn't make sense to me.

**Maggie**: right. Um, I will say, I'll, I'll preface this with saying, I've thought about this way, way too much because I, I wrote my undergraduate thesis about the quantified self movement. If you've heard of that.

**Maggie**: So, yeah, the people that enthusiastically track everything about themselves in a very hobbyist way.

Um, and so I looked at that anthropologically like, how do we, why did that become a thing that's valuable? You know, how do we become the age of the Fitbit? But this was back in like 2012, 2013 so it was even before sort of the giant wave of it, sort of wish I had like written it this year. Um.

Because it's gotten so much better.

But yeah, that it comes out of a very, uh, specific belief system about, um, what's valuable. You know, specifically like the scientific, scientific revolution. Um, you know, the enlightenment that we, you know, very much, you know, all like brains and, um, our bodies have two distinct, separate things and that the brain is better ADI.

And so we have to constantly be using our rationality to like. Keep the body in check and obsessive Lee, you know, a mass numbers on it to make sure that it's like in line with like being good, productive capitalists all the time, the most we can possibly be. Um, it comes out of very specific historical ideas that are not part of human nature, if that's even a thing and are not inevitable, you know, and we don't have to sort of value these things.

**Henry**: Yeah. And I guess that's kind of like the, the water we swim in thing where it's like, we are born into it, so we can't not think that way until you kind of realized like, that wasn't how it was until that moment.

**Maggie**: Yeah,

**Henry**: Um, and I, that's something I've been reading a lot about recently. Like that whole, I guess that.

Essentially epistemology, right? Like seeing, uh, how we learn, how we know, and as very specific way of like, truth being this, uh, abs, the most abstract thing. Uh, but then I think in experience, it's like the more abstract something is, the more it doesn't really help in a way, right? Um, it doesn't help reality.

Um, and so. Yeah. Like how do we move beyond this? Like rationalist view of everything. Yeah.

**Maggie**: yeah. I think you'd, maybe it's spoken about that on another episode. I'm trying to remember who it was with. On like the, the value of subjective truth being, being something you've realized is like so much more, um, important.

**Henry**: Um, yeah, I specifically mentioning, um, this book called personal knowledge. And I mean, I mentioned it all the time now, but I'm not tired of it yet, but, um, and it's hard to talk about it because. I don't want to come across as saying that like everything is relative and that you know like the whole like there is only or there is no truth.

Then you kind of just do whatever you want. Cause I don't actually believe that, but it's just an admission that even if there is some kind of truth out there, the only way we can experience that that is through our own personal life, which is subjective and that trying to remove your personal bias, which is not always bad.

Cause obviously bias is not necessarily. Good. Um, that if we get rid of it, that would lead to a lot of issues as well. Because, you know, this idea of, uh, being detached from reality, not experiencing the world, like what you said, like brain in a, or you can say brain in a VAT, right? Like that kind of thing.

The. And this actually ties a lot to, I think, faith in religion too, because in my reading, like, you know, especially Christians, like we kind of bought into this rationalist mode of thinking such that if you think about like the old church or even just Catholic church, you know, like there was an emphasis on ritual and liturgy, which involves the body.

You know, we think about baptism is like immersion into the water, or like an union is eating the body and the, uh, over the bread and the wine. And so. If we slowly become more and more mental, then we remove all liturgy and then church. And you know, religion becomes just belief and you know, and now the most reductive version of church is like you sing some songs and then you listen to like a.

A survey, which is just like a Ted talk or

**Maggie**: Right, right.

**Henry**: and like, is that really what church is about? Um, and so they, you don't want to go the other way where it's like too much into the liturgy where it's like the, the problem was people thought that focusing on that ritual was idolatry because we're not focusing on God, we're focusing on the things of this world.

But the other way around is like, we think that the mind is more important than the body.

**Maggie**: Right, right. That, yeah. Like the took on set in historical beliefs. Interesting. Yeah. But I

**Henry**: Know. I think that affects everything.

**Maggie**: Yeah. I like what you said though about the whole thing of the subjectivity in the, um, the, yeah, maybe an objective truth outside and apart from ourselves. Like of course there are like atoms and protons and, sure, yeah.

We know that chemistry, like we get it, that they're all like certain scientific truths about that stuff. And yet, um, it probably isn't as important or relevant or interesting to us as however we're experiencing the world and like an embodied person. You know, in a culture and a historical place in time, um, that, that experience is always going to be more important than whatever facts are in like a textbook about science.

But, but the denial of that has been like such an impressive project of like Western culture, I hope for the last couple hundred years is, yeah.

**Henry**: Yeah. I think that that's definitely a part of that philosophy where it's like 

the more abstract and mental and rational you become, the more that history doesn't actually matter, actually. Right. Anthropology doesn't matter. And thinking about those social aspects don't matter because truth becomes this embodied, right.

It becomes abstract out there, not relating to ourselves, and I think that, yeah.

**Maggie**: Yeah. I've always been, I mean, uh, found that curious or, or intriguing to about, um, maybe just talk about like, program a culture, you know, the whole, um. Um, what would you say like obsession and glorification of disembodiment in, in the sense of, you know, the whole thing of, um, hackle night drink ttw, you know, you, you are not living being, you know, you're just like a mind in the machine and you're just completely cerebral and that you don't need to like be in your body and you don't need to work out.

You don't need to move and you don't need to eat real food. Um, and even, you know, the whole, you know, the, the singularity is. Yup. All right. You're gonna upload your brain into the cloud and these, these narratives still like very present. If you get on hacker news any of these days, as for sure, at least one link that's like glorifying this exact sort of philosophy about the world, um, that it's, it's very like alive and well.

**Henry**: Yeah, I feel like I, I don't know if I bought into it, but I definitely felt it a lot. And then I think I had to realize like if I'm, at least in my faith as a Christian, it's like leaf, you know? There is aspect of, Oh, like if you think you're going to go to heaven, it's like a spiritual thing, but we talk about this idea of the incarnation of God becoming a person that's a spiritual being, becoming a physical being.

Then that would at least say that that's important. The resurrection is also the fact that, you know, body is important, right? And so from those kinds of, you know, you could say doctrines about the faith and it's like, I don't think that is compatible then and I, it's like a. Embracing of the fact that we are within a body and that you know, that physicality matters.

Um, even though I think a lot of religions actually also emphasize the spirit and the mind of the body as well.

**Maggie**: Yeah. This is even, I'm not sure if we should even get on to get onto it on, on this like episode of the podcast, but at some point, like if we want to dig into, um, . Embodiment and metaphor. So I know you just spoke about a metaphors we live by on your recent talks and that that book is like probably my favorite book in the whole world that I like can't get over and like I'm obsessed with it.

Um, but its relationship to how we talk about metaphors of, of programming and the internet is very like kind of tangential to what we're going on here. That embodiment is, is the water we swim in. And even if we don't think it, when you really look at set specific examples, it makes you realize. The way we speak about everything and the way we experience everything is like inherently embodied.

**Henry**: I see. Like, like the hunger and all these different kind of, yeah. Bodily things. Yeah, that's true. But, and then I think like. As people in tech and using tech more and more. It does cause us to forget that, right? Like we're on our screens all day and now there's  

like VR and AR and like, is it now like matrix type stuff?

Um, it does help us to forget.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's again, the hopefully see it as just like sort of like a glitch in the matrix moment or growing pains moment where we haven't figured out how to make the internet embodied yet or we haven't figured out how to make tech embodied. Um, and so we, it's like, we're just like operating as in the mindset of enlightenment, you know, mind over body.

Uh. You know, philosophy of the whole thing. So we just think we can just make everything a screen and make people stare into it and just paper with their fans and that we don't need to use the whole body. But I would hope that as things evolve in the coming decades, we'll will realize that's obviously like not working for us.

Um, and like, yeah, two things to fix embodiment and social bonds not working right now.

**Henry**: I feel like that and not they have to be related. Right? It's

**Maggie**: Yeah. Yeah. It's certainly one in the same. Yeah. This is sort of like big design problems. I do hope some, you know, high minded think tanks somewhere in Silicon Valley is taking seriously and working out in the next iteration of like the personal computer or the internet or whatever it is.

**Henry**: Yeah. I mean, there's also a sense where if the majority of Silicon Valley thinks this way, then maybe the way out is not through

**Maggie**: Yeah, actually, I mean, to be honest, it's probably not Silicon Valley. Yeah. Yeah. Um, perhaps it's, yeah. The idealistic world of the democratization of teaching other people to program are from different cultures and thinking other ways, and we'll build different things with the tools we give them.

**Henry**: Right? And I don't know how good of a hover doing at that. It's just, I just read a book called, uh, tools for conviviality. Uh, it's by this guy Ivan, Eileen, and he. It's a really difficult read for me, but a lot of it, I think about this in terms of programming where I guess he was an Aaron archivist and he thought that all institutions at some point kind of have, you know, a lot of issues.

So like having like the idea of school, he does not like that, like, or even professions. Um, and, and I think it's mostly because he thinks that. Kind of like this. It's like if there are a group of people and elite group of people, they get to decide what the future of this thing is. Then the normal people, um, don't have the chance to learn how things, things work.

Cause you have to go to school for like five years, like a doctor, you know, stuff like that. Um, and so, I mean, his view is rather, I think for most people are very extreme. But it's interesting to hear something about how. Yeah. In a way, the more professionalized something becomes, the harder it is for anyone to get into it.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Well, I mean, of all professions at the moment, like programming is  

probably the most impressive and it's openness. And. Is for the amount of, you know, gatekeeping that we complain about the, it actually is rather impressive, the welcoming and open or, or tries to be in its best efforts. Um, we know far, far more so than, than being a doctor or lawyer or, you know, whatever it is, chemical engineer.

Um, yeah, we at least have the. The narrative that anyone can be a programmer, whether they count or not, that, you know, is, is another question. But, you know, when you get into like material issues, do they actually have a laptop? Do they really have an internet connection, that sort of thing? Um.

**Henry**: Yeah. Like from that point of view, it does feel a lot more accessible. Like you just need the some sort of computer, or you can go to the library, have the internet. Um, and now we have all these free resources. I guess even open source in a way is, is part of the. 

**Maggie**: Yeah. Cause then it's the open invitation to actually build meaningful things. Right? Like that's, that's one of the most valuable entry points where you, you know, it's, it's one thing to be like, okay, just do all these programming puzzles that won't match a vest is like, do this one specific task that will go into a product that people are really using.

I imagine that's a huge tipping point for a lot of people. Yeah.

**Henry**: Yeah. And I guess, yeah, for all the issues of bootcamps, you know, I guess they have their place. In terms of, instead of going to a school

**Maggie**: Yeah. Or the, is there another one where I'm like, Oh, maybe the, the, the current, the current. Imagination of, of what a bootcamp is, is just, it's just like a bit rubbish right now and it just needs to evolve to something actually functional and not just some exploitative, like, we'll take 20% of your salary for 10 years.

**Maggie**: Um, yeah. So I know we had some other things, uh, topics, but I'm wondering if it's better safe for another one. Um, yeah.

**Henry**: cause yeah, he could probably go on for a long

**Maggie**: I'm sorry. I don't embodiment a metaphor is, it will go for a while.

**Henry**: yeah. I think that could be a good next one then. Um, yeah, we can, we can end it there then. Yeah, thanks for, thanks for chatting.

**Maggie**: Yeah. Thanks so much for having me on. I like, I so appreciate that you run this podcast and talk about things that aren't just like, what framework do I need to learn? And like what you animation library for react like this is, this is like needed interesting cultural conversation around programming.

**Henry**: thank you. Yeah, that makes me feel good too. Cause I know when I first was thinking about it, I was, I don't know. And I think I bought into that mindset too of like it has to be about code and like. Well, I like what I said, like my belief is that it's not, but then I think inside, like in my body, I still feel that way.

**Maggie**: Uh, yeah,

**Henry**: maybe going back to what I was saying about practice, it's like doing this podcast helped me to embrace that more. Yeah.

**Maggie**: yeah, yeah. And I mean. Nowadays, everything leads back to code. You can tie anything in,

**Henry**: Yeah. That's what my friends telling me all the time, cause I keep saying it and they're like, Oh yeah, Henry at you, you probably think this way.
